From an article written by Christian Heilman on the "[Web Application Myth](https://medium.com/@codepo8/the-web-application-myth-69c6b1506515)".

> Apps are software products with human interfaces. Web sites are that, too. The WYSIWYG dream of the 90s was telling people all they need to do is buy DreamWeaver and they’ll be able to build and be the same success as Amazon. This was nonsense.
