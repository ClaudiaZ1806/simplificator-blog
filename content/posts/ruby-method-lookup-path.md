In Ruby you can define methods on a class in various ways. Include, extend, inherit or define on the class. If you have multiple method definitions, which one is called? Which one is the super definition? Pascal has written a post on the [Ruby method lookup path](http://pascalbetz.github.io/ruby/2016/03/14/lookup-path/) that explains this.
