title: "Filter Rails SQL log in production"

In order to debug a problem, which only occurred in production, we recently wanted to tweak our Rails SQL logs to only show the access to a specific table.

Here's what we did to accomplish this. We created a file `initializers/filter_sql_log.rb` with this content:

\[code language="ruby"\] if Rails.env.production?

module ActiveRecord class LogSubscriber alias :old\_sql :sql

def sql(event) if event.payload\[:sql\].include? 'users' old\_sql(event) end end end end

end \[/code\]

This monkey-patches the `ActiveRecord::LogSubscriber` class and only delegates to the old logging method, if the SQL statement includes the string `"users"`.

By default, SQL logging is deactivated in the Rails production environment. Therefore we needed to change `config/environments/production.rb` like this:

\[code language="ruby"\] config.log\_level = :debug \[/code\]
